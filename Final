For my final case study I'm choosing The microservice architecture at eBay and its impacts. I do lot of shopping in eBay, therefore I was really interested 
in to this matter more than any other topic. I already started to do some research on this topic and trying to find eBay's microservice architecture and 
decisions that they made. When eBay was first introduced in 2011, it had 97 million active users with 62 billion gross merchandise volume. Therefore, eBay's IT system
had to deal with massive traffic daily with like 75 billion database calls and 250 billion search queries. Therefore, eBay began to divide everything and
implementing microservice architecture from the perspectives like improving developers productivity and enabling a faster time to market while maintaing the site stability.
